## What to implement

1. **Opening a book from `/books`** lands in the step workflow. The page reached carries
   the same `_stepper.html` navigation as creation.
2. **The detail page links to all five steps**: general info, Print setup, Puzzle
   selection, Arrangement, Finalise. These links appear **whatever the book's status**.
3. **General info edits an existing book.** A `GET/POST /book/<id>/edit` (or a reused
   `book_create.html` in edit mode) edits the New-book fields and stores them. Creation
   is unchanged.
4. **Every step renders for every status** (HTTP 200, no redirect or refusal just
   because of status). Remove any status guard on step GETs. What a *published* book may
   *change* is CARD-131's confirmation, not a refusal to render.
5. Stepper: the current step shows as "current". A book being revisited shows every
   step as reachable (components.md Stepper states: done · current · upcoming).

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-222** — given a book in status pdf_generated, when its detail page is rendered, then the page carries a link to each of the five steps — general info, Print setup, Puzzle selection, Arrangement, Finalise.
  *test:* `TestBookDetail_LinksToEveryStep`
- **AC-223** — given a draft book listed on /books, when the owner opens it from the list, then the page reached carries the same step navigation as the creation workflow.
  *test:* `TestBooksList_OpensBookInStepWorkflow`
- **AC-224** — given an existing book titled "Winter Animals", when its general-info step is submitted with the title "Winter Birds", then the stored title is "Winter Birds".
  *test:* `TestBookGeneralInfo_EditsExistingBook`
- **AC-225** — given a book in status ready_for_kdp, when its puzzle-selection step is requested, then the step renders with HTTP 200 rather than a redirect or refusal.
  *test:* `TestBookSteps_ReachableWhateverStatus`

## Guardrails

- G-1: No schema change (Increment 16 Rollback: "Additive routes and template changes … No schema change"). Do not edit `src/nonogram/db/**` or `migrations/**`.
- G-2: Revisiting a step never discards selection, order or custom titles (EC-026). A GET changes nothing.
- G-3: The published-book membership rule is not changed here. That is CARD-131 (INV-008).
- G-4: Do not edit `src/nonogram/admin/book_pdf_generator.py` (owned by CARD-127 this wave) or `src/nonogram/admin/book_proof.py` / `src/nonogram/admin/templates/book_setup_print.html` (owned by CARD-118 this wave).

## System contract

- ADR-0006/R1 — The runtime dependency set is exactly stdlib + Pillow + NumPy. No third-party package joins the installed dependencies without revising this ADR. Non-executable static assets (fonts and similar data files) may ship as … (check: TestDependencyBaseline_IsExactlyPillowAndNumpy)
- ADR-0019/R1 — The web UI adapter (src/nonogram/web/) contains HTTP concerns only — routing, form rendering, request parsing, and mapping onto orchestrator.GenerationRequest — and no domain logic or validation, mirroring cli.py; it … (check: test_every_import_in_the_package_points_inward)
- ADR-0022/R1 — Grid extent crosses module boundaries as a (width, height) pair. No public function signature, request field, or export field reduces a grid's extent to a single scalar "size", and no source mode constructs a grid from … (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0022/R3 — An uploaded image is fitted to the requested grid's aspect ratio by a centred crop, never by stretching and never by padding. A request whose grid aspect ratio differs by more than 2x from the source's INK BOUNDING BOX … (check: TestFitImage_RefusesRatioMismatchBeyondTwice)
- ADR-0022/R4 — A `--size` token carrying both dimensions specifies the grid exactly and the source is fitted to it. A bare `--size N` sets the grid's LONGER side to N and derives the other side from the source's own aspect ratio, … (check: PropertyTest_BareSize_DerivesShorterSideFromSourceShape)
- ADR-0024/R1 — A repaired random-mode grid is accepted only after a fresh solver run on its own re-derived clues reports solution_count exactly 1. The orchestrator never assumes uniqueness from the fact that a grid was repaired. (check: PropertyTest_Recovery_AcceptedGridsHaveRealVerdictsWithinOneBound)
- ADR-0024/R2 — Repairs and redraws advance the same RetryCounter bounded by MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS (30 since ADR-0002/R1; 20 when this rule was written). K, the consecutive-repair limit on one lineage, is a named constant beside it and is … (check: TestRecovery_RepairAttemptsCountAgainstRetryBound)
- ADR-0024/R3 — A repair flips exactly one filled cell and one empty cell of the parent grid, both inside the witness-disagreement set (falling back to the undecided mask only when that set holds no filled/empty pair), so the filled … (check: TestRecovery_RepairKeepsFilledCountExact)
- ADR-0024/R4 — The repair's pair choice is a deterministic function of the grid and the solver's witnesses — the region's filled and empty cells ranked by (row, column) — and draws nothing from the injected Random or from host state, … (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0024/R5 — The repair policy (POL-006) fires only for random mode. Library mode recovers by POL-001 redraw and image mode by POL-002 pixel nudge; neither ever repairs. (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0027/R1 — The valid requested density for random generation is 1..99 inclusive. Density 0 and 100 are refused as InvalidDensity by validate_density before any grid is drawn; MIN_DENSITY and MAX_DENSITY are the only statement of … (check: TestGenerateRandom_RefusesDensityZeroAndHundred)
- ADR-0027/R2 — The verdict on a requested density is made only at the validate_density seam. No later pipeline stage (uniqueness, difficulty, export, batch) rejects a request on density grounds, and no module's documentation claims … (check: TestGenerateRandom_DegenerateDensityVerdictIsMadeAtValidateDensitySeam)
- ADR-0029/R1 — The difficulty of a line-solvable puzzle is derived from the rung of the hardest technique its verifying solve required (simple_overlap < line_dp < probe_contradiction) and the share of cells settled at that rung; each … (check: TestScoreDifficulty_DeeperLineReasoningScoresHigher)
- ADR-0029/R2 — Technique classification and the strategies list are computed inside the one verifying solve, never by re-solving; the ordered rung list the solver reports IS the puzzle's strategies list, and the tier is derived from … (check: TestGenerate_StrategiesRecordedFromTheOneVerifyingSolve)
- ADR-0029/R3 — No clock reading — elapsed_seconds or any other — and no size or density term enters the difficulty score, the tier decision or the strategies list; the score is a pure function of the rung tags of the solve and … (check: PropertyTest_ScoreDifficulty_IndependentOfElapsedTime)
- ADR-0029/R4 — The overlap masks that define the simple_overlap rung are computed relative to the line's already-known cells (the leftmost and rightmost placements consistent with them, intersected), and are re-derived natively inside … (check: test_every_import_in_the_package_points_inward)
- ADR-0029/R5 — Rung attribution is reported only for a clue set with exactly one solution; a clue set with 0 or >= 2 solutions is not a puzzle, has no grade, and carries no attribution at all (empty or None per-cell tags, an all-zero … (check: PropertyTest_SolveStrategies_RungsInvariantUnderTransposition)
- ADR-0032/R1 — Every puzzle stored through the admin panel has been proved uniquely solvable by the solver at the storage boundary itself. add_puzzle re-derives the clues from the grid it was handed and refuses, with … (check: TestStorageBoundary_AsksTheSolverNotTheCaller)
- ADR-0032/R2 — quality_score is an integer 1..100 when the conversion was measured and None when there was nothing to measure; None means unknown, not zero. An unmeasured puzzle never satisfies a quality minimum, is never the left … (check: TestUnmeasuredQuality_SurvivesTheFilter)
- ADR-0033/R1 — Book assembly references puzzles by id and never changes a puzzle's grid, clues, difficulty tier or strategies; the only puzzle field it may write is the book-membership mirror (puzzles.book_id). (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0035/R1 — No book leaves draft (to any other status) unless it has a stored plan and every longest-side x tier cell's count, divided by the planned total, is within +/-3 percentage points of that cell's planned share. (check: TestBookStatus_EveryExitFromDraftIsGatedOnThePlan)
- ADR-0036/R1 — compute_layout called without a PageSpec produces exactly today's A4 geometry; CLI and web output are byte-for-byte unchanged by any book-only PageSpec field. (check: TestLayout_DefaultPageSpecIsByteIdenticalToA4Golden)
- ADR-0036/R2 — Book page geometry is computed only by COMP-007's layout functions (compute_layout, and the pair-aware call for two-up pages) with the book's PageSpec; the admin panel does not fit cells or place grid lines itself. (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0037/R1 — A book puzzle page never prints the picture's title; its band shows the puzzle number and the solver's tier only. (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0037/R2 — Under the book PageSpec every thin grid rule is at least 0.25 mm and every heavy rule is twice the thin rule, in pure black; the default PageSpec's strokes are unchanged. (check: review-lens)

- CON-009 — The web UI's HTTP server binds its listening socket to 127.0.0.1 (loopback) only, and refuses connections arriving on any other interface. Restates NFR-003/AC-052 as a gate-enforced mandatory constraint — a `check:` the … (check: TestWebServer_BindsLoopbackOnlyByDefault)

- CON-011 — Each grid side is 10 to 30 cells inclusive. 30 replaces 50 as MAX_SIZE project-wide and applies to every source mode (random, built-in library, uploaded image) and to both inbound adapters (CLI and web UI). This … (check: PropertyTest_GridDimensions_EverySourceModeRejectsSideOutside10To30)
- CON-012 — A generation request whose grid aspect ratio differs from the uploaded source image's INK BOUNDING BOX ratio (ADR-0022 revision 2026-09-01, DEC-025 — not its as-decoded file ratio) by more than 2x is refused with an … (check: PropertyTest_AspectGuard_AcceptsExactlyThoseRequestsRetainingHalfOrMore)
- CON-015 — The admin panel's own entry point binds its listening socket to 127.0.0.1 (loopback) only and runs with the debugger off. The bind address is a constant, not a parameter: no supported call into nonogram.admin.app widens … (check: TestAdminPanel_BindsLoopbackOnlyByDefault)
- CON-016 — The admin panel serves a request through exactly one of two mutually exclusive doors, chosen by whether ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOST is set, and refuses every request that does not pass the door in force. With it unset (the … (check: TestAdminPanel_RefusesEveryRequestTheDoorInForceDoesNotAdmit)
