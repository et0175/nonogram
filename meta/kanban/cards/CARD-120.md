## What to implement

1. **Migration `010_book_distribution_plan.py`** (COMP-010). It adds nullable plan
   storage on `books`: the count, the split, the 4 × 3 per-bucket matrix and the
   hand-edited cell set. A mutation-tracked JSON column is acceptable (follow CARD-101's
   `MutableDict.as_mutable(JSON)` precedent; plain `JSON` silently loses in-place
   edits). Include a working `downgrade`. **No backfill:** legacy books stay plan-less,
   and ADR-0035 refuses them at the gate with a remedy (CARD-124). Use the next free
   revision number at implementation time and chain `down_revision`.
2. **`BookManager`**: `get_plan(book_id)` and `save_plan(book_id, plan)` go through
   CARD-119's `DistributionPlan`, which rejects a split that does not sum to 100. They
   work in both storage modes (in-memory and DB). `create_book` stores
   `book_plan.DEFAULT_PLAN` (150 at 40/40/20, prefilled; ADR-0034).
3. **Print setup** (`/book/<id>/setup-print`, `book_setup_print.html`) shows:
   - the count and the three split fields;
   - the per-bucket matrix as 12 editable integer inputs, prefilled from the stored plan
     (or the prefill of the stored split);
   - on submit: a changed split re-derives an un-edited matrix (POL-007). A cell whose
     value differs from the prefill is recorded as hand-edited, and hand-edited cells
     keep their values;
   - a warning when hand-edited cells disagree with the general split (AC-203);
   - a refusal that leaves the stored plan unchanged when the split ≠ 100% (AC-197).
   The existing trim and margin fields on the same page keep working unchanged.
4. **Changing the plan never touches the selection.** `save_plan` writes plan columns
   only. It never writes `puzzle_ids`, `puzzle_titles` or order (FR-038, AC-228 is
   asserted in CARD-131; do not break it here).

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-196** — given a draft book whose Print setup is saved with count 150 and split 40/40/20, when the owner leaves the workflow and reopens Print setup, then the page shows count 150 and split 40/40/20 read back from the stored book.
  *test:* `TestBookPlan_StoredWithBookSurvivesReopen`
- **AC-197** (INV-005) — given a draft book with a stored plan of 150 at 40/40/20, when Print setup is submitted with split 40/40/30 (110%), then the submission is rejected and the stored plan stays 150 at 40/40/20.
  *test:* `TestBookPlan_RejectsSplitNotSummingTo100`
- **AC-203** — given the same hand-edited plan after the split change to 30/45/25, when Print setup is rendered, then the page shows a warning that the per-bucket plan disagrees with the general split.
  *test:* `TestBookPlan_WarnsWhenHandEditedMatrixDisagreesWithSplit`
- **AC-204** (INV-005) — given a new book created with no Print setup values entered, when its stored plan is read, then the split sums to 100% and the per-bucket plan equals the prefill of that split.
  *test:* `TestBookCreate_StoresDefaultPlanThatSumsTo100`
- **AC-205** — given a new book created with no Print setup values entered, when its stored plan is read, then the plan is 150 puzzles at 40/40/20 (60/60/30).
  *test:* `TestBookCreate_DefaultPlanIs150At40_40_20`

## Engineering constraints

- **EC-023** (consistency, INV-005) — For any count of at least 1 and any split summing to 100%, the prefilled per-bucket plan has 12 non-negative integer cells whose sum equals the count, whose per-tier column totals equal the general plan's tier counts, and whose zero-share cells (<=15 x hard, 26-30 x easy) are 0 — for every count and split, not only the measured examples.
  *test:* `PropertyTest_BookPlan_PrefillTotalsMatchGeneralPlan` (CARD-119 — extend with a store/reload round-trip: a plan read back equals the plan saved, in both storage modes)

## Guardrails

- G-1: Out of scope: an audience-derived default split (AC-206/AC-207 retired, ADR-0034). The `target_audience` column stays free text and is not read by plan code.
- G-2: Saving a plan never changes the selection, order or custom titles (FR-038/EC-026).
- G-3: Existing books are not backfilled. A plan-less book stays readable and editable (Rollback: "stored plans … are simply ignored by the old code").
- G-4: Do not edit `src/nonogram/export/**`. It is owned by CARD-114 this wave.
- G-5: The gate (`set_book_status`) is not changed here; that is CARD-124.

- ADR-0036/R2 — Book page geometry is computed only by COMP-007's layout functions (compute_layout, and the pair-aware call for two-up pages) with the book's PageSpec; the admin panel does not fit cells or place grid lines itself. (check: review-lens)
