## What to implement

**Current behaviour (verified by reading the code and `export/layout.py`'s own docstrings).**

- A book cell is fitted **per puzzle, on that puzzle's real clue depth**: `cell = min(7.5,
  usable_w / (width + row-clue depth), ...)` (`export/layout.py:1966`), inside NFR-008's
  4.8..7.5 mm band. So two 20x20 puzzles print at different sizes when their clue columns
  differ in width — exactly the owner's issue 4.
- A shared (two-up) page already reduces to a shared cell (`export/layout.py:1909`), but the
  shared figure is derived from the pair, not from the book.

**What changes.**

1. **One cell size per grid size, book-wide.** All 20x20 puzzles in a book print at the same
   cell; all 25x15 at theirs. The size for a grid size is the **smallest** size that every
   puzzle of that grid size in this book can take — i.e. fitted against the deepest clue
   stack among them, so no puzzle of that size overflows.
2. The flat **7.5 mm cap stands** (NFR-008's standard cell, and the owner restates it).
3. **Two puzzles sharing a page use the smaller of their two sizes** — the owner's rule,
   which is what makes their grids line up (and what CARD-226 then aligns the slots around).
4. NFR-008 says the cell is fitted "per puzzle on its real clue depth". This card replaces
   that with a per-grid-size, per-book rule, so an **NFR-008 amendment is owed at the
   architect station**; this card flags it and does not edit `meta/architecture/**`.
5. Record the cost honestly: a book-wide size is by construction **≤** the per-puzzle size, so
   some puzzles print smaller than they do today. Measure the corpus's distribution before and
   after and state the worst case, including whether anything lands on NFR-008's 4.8 mm floor
   (and therefore on FR-031's below-floor flag).

## Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1** (happy, one size per grid size): *Given* a book holding several 20x20 puzzles with
  different clue depths, *when* the interior is exported, *then* every one of them is drawn at
  the same cell size, measured off the ink. (test: `TestBookCellSize_SameGridSizeSameCell`)
- **AC-2** (happy, the deepest clue stack decides): *Given* that set, *then* the shared size
  equals the size the *deepest-clued* member would have taken alone — so nothing overflows
  and nothing is smaller than it needs to be. (test: `TestBookCellSize_FitsTheDeepestMember`)
- **AC-3** (happy, the cap): *Given* a book of small grids with shallow clues, *then* the cell
  is 7.5 mm and not larger. (test: `TestBookCellSize_HoldsTheSevenAndAHalfMillimetreCap`)
- **AC-4** (happy, a shared page): *Given* two puzzles of different grid sizes on one page,
  *then* both are drawn at the smaller of their two book sizes.
  (test: `TestBookCellSize_SharedPageTakesTheSmaller`)
- **AC-5** (edge, one puzzle of its size): *Given* a grid size with exactly one puzzle in the
  book, *then* the rule degenerates to today's per-puzzle fit for it.
  (test: `TestBookCellSize_SoleMemberOfItsSize`)
- **AC-6** (edge, the floor): *Given* a book whose deepest-clued 30x30 forces a cell below
  NFR-008's 4.8 mm floor, *then* the below-floor flag FR-031 already defines is raised for
  **every** puzzle of that grid size, not only the one that forced it — the flag must describe
  what is printed. (test: `TestBookCellSize_BelowFloorFlagFollowsTheSharedSize`)
- **AC-7** (guard, determinism): *Given* the same book, *when* the sizes are computed twice,
  *then* they are identical, and they do not depend on the order the puzzles were added.
  (test: `TestBookCellSize_IsOrderIndependent`)

## Guardrails

- G-1: NFR-008's 4.8..7.5 mm band is not widened — this card changes how the figure is
  *chosen*, not what is allowed (test: the existing NFR-008 tests).
- G-2: FR-031's below-floor flag and per-puzzle override keep working (test: the existing
  FR-031 tests).
- G-3: A puzzle's grid, clues, tier and strategies are never changed — ADR-0033/R1. This card
  changes a drawing size only (check: review-lens).
- G-4: Out of scope — where the grid sits (CARD-224), the slot split (CARD-226), clue boxes
  (CARD-208).
- G-5: Baselines re-recorded with provenance; no earlier fixture regenerated or deleted.

## System contract

- **NFR-008** — book cell in [4.8, 7.5] mm per puzzle on its real clue depth; AC-236..AC-239.
  **Amendment owed:** the "per puzzle on its real clue depth" clause becomes "per grid size
  per book, fitted to the deepest-clued member" (check: review-lens)
- FR-031 — below-floor flag and per-puzzle override (check: the FR-031 tests)
- CON-020 — the clue digits are the one exemption from the 10 pt floor, and they shrink with
  the cell (check: `TestInteriorType_EveryFaceHoldsTheFloor`)
- ADR-0033/R1 — book assembly never changes a puzzle's grid, clues, tier or strategies
  (check: review-lens)
- ADR-0036/R2 — geometry from COMP-007 (check: review-lens)

## Architecture context

- **FR:** FR-031 (the floor flag), FR-040 (pairing — a shared page's size rule).
- **NFR:** **NFR-008 (amendment owed)**.
- **CON:** CON-018, CON-020.
- **ADR:** ADR-0033/R1, ADR-0036/R2.
- **Components:** COMP-007, COMP-009.
- **Trace:** not updated by this card.

## Worktree notes

- [Why this is P1 and architectural] It is the only card of the set that changes what the
  reader *solves* rather than where it sits: a smaller cell is a harder puzzle to mark by
  hand. NFR-008's band exists for that reason, and this card moves a figure inside it for
  every puzzle in the book at once.
