## What to implement

The marking controls the owner's document lists, kept "as simple as
possible, similar to puzzle-nonograms.com". The document says no more
options than these for now.

1. **Tool picker:** three tools: **black** (filled), **white** (marked
   empty, drawn as a dot or a small cross), and **undecided** (clears a
   cell). Exactly one tool is active. Pick it by button and by keyboard.
2. **Click cycle in the grid:** clicking a cell cycles it: 1st click
   black, 2nd click white, 3rd click clear. This is independent of the
   active tool, as the document describes.
   **Owner answer (2026-10-03, FR-044 AC-303/304):** a click always cycles,
   whatever tool is selected. The selected tool governs drags.
3. **Drag to mark a region:** press on a cell and drag, and every cell
   passed over takes the active tool's state. Constrain a drag to the row
   or column it started in, as the reference site does; that's the usual
   nonogram behaviour and avoids smearing diagonals. One drag is one
   history step.
4. **Undo and redo:** buttons plus Ctrl/Cmd+Z and Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+Z. Undo
   reverts a whole stroke (one click, or one drag). A new mark after an
   undo drops the redo stack.
5. **Touch:** tap and drag must work on a tablet-sized touch screen. This
   is the cheapest moment to get it right, since phones are where printed
   QR codes will land later.

State changes go through CARD-160's pure state module (apply stroke,
undo, redo), so the logic is testable without a browser. Rendering only
reflects state.

## Acceptance criteria

_Verbatim from FR-044 in meta/architecture/requirements.yml (architect delta 2026-10-03)._

- **AC-303** (happy): *Given* an undecided cell on the player page with the filled tool selected, *when* the cell is clicked three times, *then* its state goes filled, then marked empty, then undecided, drawn black, then as a dot or small cross, then blank.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_ClickCycles*
- **AC-304** (boundary): *Given* an undecided cell with the empty tool selected, *when* the cell is clicked once, *then* the cell becomes filled, not marked empty — a click cycles whatever tool is selected.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_ClickIgnoresTheSelectedTool*
- **AC-305** (happy): *Given* a blank board with the filled tool selected, *when* the pointer is pressed on row 2 column 3 and dragged along row 2 to column 7, *then* exactly the five cells row 2 columns 3-7 are filled and every other cell is undecided.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_DragMarksOneLine*
- **AC-306** (boundary): *Given* a blank board with the filled tool selected, *when* a drag starts on row 2 column 3 and wanders through row 3 column 5 to row 4 column 7, *then* only cells of row 2 are marked, and no cell of rows 3 or 4 changes.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_DragMarksOneLine*
- **AC-307** (happy): *Given* a blank board on which one five-cell drag and then two single clicks on other cells are made, *when* undo is pressed three times and then redo three times, *then* after the undos the board is entirely undecided, and after the redos it shows all seven marks again.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_UndoRedoByStroke*
- **AC-308** (negative): *Given* the board of AC-307 after one undo, *when* a new single click marks another cell, *then* redo is disabled and pressing it changes no cell — the undone stroke cannot be restored.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_UndoRedoByStroke*
- **AC-309** (happy): *Given* a board with two strokes and keyboard focus on the page, *when* Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on macOS) is pressed, then Shift+Ctrl+Z (Shift+Cmd+Z), *then* the first key undoes the last stroke and the second redoes it.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_KeyboardAndLabels*
- **AC-310** (boundary): *Given* the player page of a stored puzzle, *when* the filled, empty and undecided tools and the undo, redo and reset controls are inspected and operated from the keyboard alone, *then* each control has a non-empty accessible name, is reachable by Tab, and acts on Enter or Space.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_KeyboardAndLabels*
- **AC-311** (negative): *Given* the player page has finished loading, *when* 20 strokes of clicks and drags are made, *then* the browser issues no network request.
  *test: TestSolverMarking_NoRequestPerMark*

## Engineering constraints

_Verbatim from FR-044._

- **EC-035** (consistency): For any sequence of strokes, undos and redos, replaying the remaining undo history from a blank board reproduces the current board exactly, cell for cell — verified over a seeded random sequence of at least 500 strokes mixing clicks, drags with each tool, undos and redos, with the minimum count asserted in the test.
  *test: PropertyTest_SolverHistory_ReplayReproducesTheBoard*

## Guardrails

- G-1: No new runtime dependency (ADR-0006/R1); plain JS as decided in
  ADR-0038.
- G-2: The board does not reveal correctness while marking. Errors and
  the solved state are CARD-162's, so this card must not leak whether a
  mark is right.
- G-3: No server round-trip per mark; marking is entirely client-side.

## System contract

_Assembled 2026-10-03 by `system_rules.py --card CARD-161` (52 rules). A projection — fix the source artifact, never this list._

## Worktree notes

- [Origin] Cut 2026-10-03 from the owner's design doc at the owner's request.
- [Estimate] 1d is the card-size ceiling. If the click-cycle/tool question
  and touch support push it over, split touch support into its own card
  instead of growing this one.
- [Architect delta] 2026-10-03 — unblocked: CON-002 superseded by CON-021; FR-044 (US-028, CAP-007) and ADR-0038 (resolving DEC-040/041) now exist; acceptance criteria re-cut verbatim from FR-044 and the system contract assembled. Owner answers folded in: a click always cycles, tools govern drags; the error count is the live number of wrong marks.
